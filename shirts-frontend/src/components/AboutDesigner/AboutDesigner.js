                    My name is Janelle, designer and owner of JB Designs.
                    I started screen printing because I wanted to 
                    make a good quality product that lasts the wear and tear of everyday
                    life and your washing machine. I began learning how to do screen printing
                    by watching countless youtube videos. It all began a little over a year ago (October 2019)
                    in my basement where I experimented with several screen printing processes and started growing
                    my business. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="info">I look forward to working with you! </p>
